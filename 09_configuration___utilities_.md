# Chapter 9: Configuration & Utilities

Welcome to the final chapter of our `test_app_new` tutorial! In the [previous chapter](08_geographic_data_preparation_.md), we looked at a special setup step: [Geographic Data Preparation](08_geographic_data_preparation_.md), where we created the `countries.p` file to help our main application quickly map locations.

Throughout the previous chapters, you might have noticed certain values (like the database filename `Twitterdata.db` or the keywords `["Corona", "COVID19"]`) appearing in different scripts (`dataExtraction.py`, `app.py`). You might have also seen similar helper functions (like converting time formats or cleaning text) being used.

What if you decided to change the database filename? Or add a new keyword to track? You'd have to find and update it in multiple places, which is risky â€“ you might miss one! And what if you wanted to improve the text cleaning logic? You'd have to change it everywhere it's used.

This chapter introduces the solution: the **Configuration & Utilities** module (`config.py`). It's like our application's central settings menu and toolbox, solving the problem of scattered settings and duplicated helper code.

## What is the Configuration & Utilities Module?

Imagine you're building something complex, like a robot. You wouldn't want the settings for its motor speed, sensor sensitivity, and the brand of batteries it uses scattered randomly throughout its wiring diagrams! You'd want a central control panel or settings file. Similarly, you'd want a toolbox with standard tools (like a screwdriver, wrench) that different parts of the robot-building process can use, rather than having everyone invent their own slightly different screwdriver.

The `config.py` file in our project acts as both:

1.  **Settings Menu (Configuration):** It holds important, constant values that other parts of the application need to know. Examples:
    *   `DATABASE_NAME`: The name of our SQLite database file (`'Twitterdata.db'`).
    *   `TABLE_NAME`: The name of the table within the database (`'Tweets'`).
    *   `TRACK_WORDS_KEY`: The main keyword we're tracking (used for display).
    *   Country data loaded from `countries.p`.

2.  **Toolbox (Utilities):** It contains reusable helper functions that perform common tasks needed by different scripts. Examples:
    *   `polarity_change`: Converts the raw sentiment polarity score into a simple -1, 0, or 1.
    *   `dateconversion`: Converts timestamp formats (like from UTC to local time).
    *   `hastag`: Extracts hashtags from text.
    *   `datakeyValue`: Prepares word frequency data for the word cloud.
    *   `clean_tweet`, `deEmojify`: Functions for cleaning text (though these are also present in `dataExtraction.py` - ideally they would *only* be in `config.py` for perfect consistency).

By keeping these in one place (`config.py`), we make our application:
*   **Easier to Maintain:** Need to change the database name? Edit only `config.py`.
*   **More Consistent:** Everyone uses the *same* settings and the *same* helper functions.
*   **More Organized:** It's clear where to find important parameters and common tools.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Configuration Variables:** These are just regular Python variables defined in `config.py` that store fixed values. They are typically named in `ALL_CAPS` to indicate they are constants (e.g., `DATABASE_NAME`).
2.  **Utility Functions:** These are standard Python functions defined in `config.py` that perform a specific, reusable task.
3.  **Importing:** Other Python files (`app.py`, `dataExtraction.py`) can access these variables and functions by simply importing the `config` module. A common way is `import config as c`, which lets you use `c.VARIABLE_NAME` or `c.function_name()`.

## How We Use `config.py`

Let's see how other parts of our project use this central module.

**1. Defining Settings and Helpers in `config.py`:**

First, take a look at a simplified version of `config.py`:

```python
# --- File: config.py ---
import pickle
import re
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from dateutil import tz
from nltk.probability import FreqDist

# --- Configuration Variables ---
DATABASE_NAME = 'Twitterdata.db'
TABLE_NAME = "Tweets"
TRACK_WORDS_KEY = ["COVID19"] # Main keyword for display

# Load pre-prepared geographic data (from Chapter 8)
STATES, STATE_DICT, INV_STATE_DICT = pickle.load(open('countries.p', 'rb'))

# --- Utility Functions ---

def polarity_change(polarity):
    """Converts polarity score to -1, 0, or 1."""
    if polarity < 0:
        return -1
    elif polarity > 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return 0

def dateconversion(text_timestamp):
    """Converts UTC timestamp string to local datetime object."""
    from_zone = tz.tzutc()
    to_zone = tz.tzlocal()
    utc = datetime.strptime(text_timestamp, '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    utc = utc.replace(tzinfo=from_zone)
    local_time = utc.astimezone(to_zone)
    return local_time

def hastag(text):
    """Extracts #hashtags from text."""
    return re.findall(r'\B#\w*[a-zA-Z]+\w*', text)

def datakeyValue(words):
    """Calculates word frequencies for word cloud."""
    fdist = FreqDist(words)
    # Return top 2000 words as {word: frequency}
    return dict(fdist.most_common(2000))

# ... other potential helpers like clean_tweet, deEmojify ...
```
*   This file defines variables like `DATABASE_NAME` and functions like `polarity_change`. It's just a standard Python file.

**2. Using Configuration in `dataExtraction.py`:**

Our [Twitter Data Streamer](02_twitter_data_streamer_.md) needs the database name and table name.

```python
# --- File: dataExtraction.py ---
import sqlite3
import tweepy
# Import the config module, giving it a shorter alias 'c'
import config as c

# --- Use configuration variables ---
DATABASE_NAME_FROM_CONFIG = c.DATABASE_NAME # Use the variable from config.py
TABLE_NAME_FROM_CONFIG = c.TABLE_NAME     # Use the variable from config.py

# Connect to the database defined in config.py
conn = sqlite3.connect(DATABASE_NAME_FROM_CONFIG)
mycursor = conn.cursor()
# Ensure the table defined in config.py exists
# (Ideally, TABLE_ATTRIBUTES would also be in config.py)
TABLE_ATTRIBUTES = "id_str ..., created_at DATETIME, text ..., polarity ..."
mycursor.execute(f"CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {TABLE_NAME_FROM_CONFIG} ({TABLE_ATTRIBUTES})")
conn.commit()
mycursor.close()
conn.close() # Close initial connection

class MyStreamListener(tweepy.StreamListener):
    def on_status(self, status):
        # ... (extract tweet data) ...
        polarity = sentiment.polarity
        # ...

        # Save to the database specified in config.py
        db_conn = sqlite3.connect(c.DATABASE_NAME)
        cursor = db_conn.cursor()
        # Use the table name from config.py
        sql = f"INSERT INTO {c.TABLE_NAME} (...) VALUES (?, ?, ...)"
        val = (id_str, created_at, text, polarity, ...) # Data to insert
        cursor.execute(sql, val)
        db_conn.commit()
        cursor.close()
        db_conn.close()
        return True
# ... (rest of the script) ...
```
*   `import config as c` makes everything in `config.py` available under the prefix `c.`.
*   We use `c.DATABASE_NAME` and `c.TABLE_NAME` instead of hardcoding the strings `"Twitterdata.db"` and `"Tweets"`. If we change these values in `config.py`, `dataExtraction.py` will automatically use the new values next time it runs.

**3. Using Utilities in `app.py`:**

Our [Dash Web Application](01_dash_web_application_.md) uses both configuration variables and utility functions during its update callbacks.

```python
# --- File: app.py ---
import dash
import pandas as pd
import sqlite3
import datetime
# Import the config module
import config as c

# ... (app setup) ...

# Inside the 'update_graph_live' callback function
def update_graph_live(n):
    # --- Use config variables ---
    conn = sqlite3.connect(c.DATABASE_NAME) # Use database name from config
    timenow = (datetime.datetime.utcnow() - datetime.timedelta(minutes=30)).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S')
    # Use table name from config
    query = f"SELECT ..., polarity, created_at FROM {c.TABLE_NAME} WHERE created_at >= '{timenow}'"
    df = pd.read_sql(query, con=conn)
    conn.close()

    # --- Use utility functions ---
    # Apply the polarity conversion function from config.py
    df['polarity'] = df['polarity'].apply(c.polarity_change)
    # Apply the date conversion function from config.py
    df['created_at'] = df['created_at'].apply(c.dateconversion)
    # Convert to datetime objects (handling potential timezone info)
    df['created_at'] = pd.to_datetime(df['created_at']).dt.tz_localize(None)

    # ... (rest of the analysis using the processed df) ...
    # Use the keyword from config for display
    num_mentions_col = f"Num of '{c.TRACK_WORDS_KEY[0]}' mentions"
    # ... (create visualizations) ...

# Inside the 'update_graph_bottom_live' callback function
def update_graph_bottom_live(n):
    # ... (fetch data including 'text') ...
    content = ' '.join(df["text"])
    # ... (clean content) ...

    # --- Use utility function ---
    # Extract hashtags using the helper from config.py
    hashtags = c.hastag(content)
    # ... (tokenize words, remove stopwords) ...
    # Calculate word frequencies using helper from config.py
    word_cloud_words = c.datakeyValue(filtered_sent)

    # --- Use config data (loaded inside config.py) ---
    # Access the country data loaded in config.py
    STATES, STATE_DICT, INV_STATE_DICT = c.STATES, c.STATE_DICT, c.INV_STATE_DICT
    # ... (perform geographic mapping using these structures) ...
    # ... (create visualizations) ...
```
*   Again, we `import config as c`.
*   We use `c.DATABASE_NAME` and `c.TABLE_NAME`.
*   Crucially, we call helper functions like `c.polarity_change()` and `c.dateconversion()` to process data consistently, without redefining these functions inside `app.py`.
*   We even access the pre-loaded country data (`c.STATES`, `c.STATE_DICT`, `c.INV_STATE_DICT`) that `config.py` loaded from the `countries.p` file.

## What Happens Under the Hood?

There's no complex magic here. When Python encounters `import config as c`, it simply does the following:

1.  Looks for a file named `config.py` in the same directory (or other standard locations).
2.  Executes the code inside `config.py` from top to bottom. This runs the variable assignments (like `DATABASE_NAME = '...'`) and the `def` statements for functions. It also runs the `pickle.load` line to load the country data.
3.  Creates a "module object" that holds all the variables and functions defined in `config.py`.
4.  Makes this module object available in the importing file (`app.py` or `dataExtraction.py`) under the name `c` (because we used `as c`).

So, accessing `c.DATABASE_NAME` is just looking up the `DATABASE_NAME` variable within the loaded `config` module object. Calling `c.polarity_change()` executes the function defined in `config.py`.

It's a fundamental Python mechanism for organizing code into reusable modules.

## Conclusion

In this final chapter, we learned about the **Configuration & Utilities** module (`config.py`), which acts as our project's central settings menu and toolbox.

*   It consolidates important parameters (like `DATABASE_NAME`, `TABLE_NAME`, `TRACK_WORDS_KEY`) into **configuration variables**.
*   It centralizes common helper code (like `polarity_change`, `dateconversion`, `hastag`) into **utility functions**.
*   Other scripts (`app.py`, `dataExtraction.py`) access these by simply using `import config as c`.

Using `config.py` promotes:
*   **Consistency:** Ensures all parts of the application use the same settings and logic.
*   **Maintainability:** Makes updates easier by requiring changes in only one place.
*   **Organization:** Keeps the codebase tidier and easier to understand.

This concludes our tour through the main components of the `test_app_new` project! We've journeyed from setting up the [Dash Web Application](01_dash_web_application_.md) user interface, collecting data with the [Twitter Data Streamer](02_twitter_data_streamer_.md), storing it in [Data Storage (SQLite)](03_data_storage__sqlite__.md), performing [Sentiment & Time-Series Analysis](04_sentiment___time_series_analysis_.md) and [Text & Geographic Analysis](05_text___geographic_analysis_.md), creating [Visualization Components](06_visualization_components_.md), enabling updates with the [Real-time Update Engine](07_real_time_update_engine_.md), preparing data with [Geographic Data Preparation](08_geographic_data_preparation_.md), and finally, organizing settings and tools with [Configuration & Utilities](09_configuration___utilities_.md).

We hope this tutorial has given you a clear understanding of how these different pieces work together to create a functional real-time analysis dashboard. Happy coding!
